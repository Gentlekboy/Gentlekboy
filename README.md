### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Being driven to always learn, I have taught myself how to build responsive web pages using modern front-end technologies (HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript).
A the moment, I am learning to use Node JS in building full-stack applications to solve problems.
I currently work as a Data Annotator for Machine Learning but I am looking for Internships and Junior Software Developer roles to hone my skillsets and improve my knowledge of JavaScript.
I am also open for collaborations and projects.
